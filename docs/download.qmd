The released versions of the software is available from Maven Central
repository. The stable releases (currently 0.6.0) is available from all Maven
repos, while the developer version (*-SNAPSHOT) is available only from the 
[Sonatype Maven repository](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/de/gwdg/metadataqa/metadata-qa-marc/0.5.0/).
What you need to select is the file `metadata-qa-marc-0.6.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar`. 

Be aware that no automation exists for creating a current developer version as
nightly build, so there is a chance that the latest features are not available
in this version. If you want to use the latest version, do build it.

Since the jar file doesn't contain the helper scripts, you might also consider
downloading them from this GitHub repository:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pkiraly/qa-catalogue/master/common-script
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pkiraly/qa-catalogue/master/validator
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pkiraly/qa-catalogue/master/formatter
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pkiraly/qa-catalogue/master/tt-completeness
```

You should adjust `common-script` to point to the jar file you just downloaded.
