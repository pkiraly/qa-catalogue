Welcome to QA catalogue

The stage is yours! Typical next steps follow as

  1) copy bibliographical records to 'input' directory, adjust 'qa-catalogue.env', and 'web-config/configuration.cnf'
  2) start services with './service.sh up'
  3) run analyses with 'docker/qa-catalogue ...'
  4) check it at http://localhost:90
  if you do not need it anymore
  5) shut services down with './service.sh down'
  6) remove all files with './service.sh clear-files'
