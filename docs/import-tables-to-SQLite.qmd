title: "Import tables to SQLite"
---

This is just a helper function which imports the results of validation into
SQLite3 database.

The prerequisite of this step is to run validation first, since it uses the
files produced there. If you run validation with `catalogues/<catalogue>.sh` or
`./qa-catalogue` scripts, this importing step is already covered there.

Usage:
```bash
catalogues/[catalogue].sh sqlite
```
or
```bash
./qa-catalogue --params="[options]" sqlite
```

options:

* [general parameters](#general-parameters)

Output:

* `qa_catalogue.sqlite`: the SQLite3 database with 3 tables: `issue_details`,
`issue_groups`, and `issue_summary`.
