title: "Thompson-Traill completeness"
---

Kelly Thompson and Stacie Traill recently published their approach to calculate
the quality of ebook records coming from different data sources. Their article
is _Implementation of the scoring algorithm described in Leveraging Python to
improve ebook metadata selection, ingest, and management._ In Code4Lib Journal,
Issue 38, 2017-10-18. http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/12828

```bash
java -cp $JAR de.gwdg.metadataqa.marc.cli.ThompsonTraillCompleteness [options] <file>
```
or with a bash script
```bash
./tt-completeness [options] <file>
```
or
```bash
catalogues/[catalogue].sh tt-completeness
```
or
```bash
./qa-catalogue --params="[options]" tt-completeness
```

options:

* [general parameters](#general-parameters)
* `-F <file>`, `--fileName <file>`: the name of report the program produces.
  Default is `tt-completeness.csv`.

It produces a CSV file like this:
