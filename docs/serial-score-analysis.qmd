title: "Serial score analysis"
---

These scores are calculated for each continuing resources (type of record
(LDR/6) is language material ('a') and bibliographic level (LDR/7) is serial
component part ('b'), integrating resource ('i') or serial ('s')).

The calculation is based on a slightly modified version of the method published
by Jamie Carlstone in the following paper:

Jamie Carlstone (2017) _Scoring the Quality of E-Serials MARC Records Using
Java_, Serials Review, 43:3-4, pp. 271-277, DOI: [10.1080/00987913.2017.1350525](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00987913.2017.1350525)

```bash
java -cp $JAR de.gwdg.metadataqa.marc.cli.SerialScore [options] <file>
```
with a bash script
```bash
./serial-score [options] <file>
```
or
```bash
catalogues/[catalogue].sh serial-score
```
or
```bash
./qa-catalogue --params="[options]" serial-score
```

options:

* [general parameters](#general-parameters)
* `-F <file>`, `--fileName <file>`: the report file name. Default is
  `shelf-ready-completeness.csv`.
